# A two-panel layout built in Angular

![Screenshot](ang-1.jpg)

My first Angular app built using the Angular CLI, version 7.1.2. A two-panel jobs overview interface rendering a list of unfinished jobs (left) and a detailed job description (right panel). The jobs are loaded with an HTTP-Request from a JSON file.
